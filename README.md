# School_Management_System
 A simple grading and absence management system for students. 
 The program enables the user to add the class name, the number of students in that class, add the grades, and the number of absences for each student.
 The program displays the available options in the system which are Grades, Absences, and Exit.
 1. When the user chooses Grades, it allows them to enter the course name, the number of students, the studentâ€™s scores.
 Then it calculates the student's final score, and assign the corresponding letter grade.
 
2. When the user chooses Absences, it allows them to enter the course name, the number of students, and the number of absences.
 Then it will get an ID and provide a warning message.
 
 3. If the user chooses Exit, the system will exit.
